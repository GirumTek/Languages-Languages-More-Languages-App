- View top 10 most spoken languages
- Use a randomizer to discover languages
- See detailed statistics including:
  - Language rank
  - Number of speakers (in millions)
  - Percentage of world population speaking the language

  ## Technical Details
- Built with JavaScript
- Uses data from "Most Spoken Languages Worldwide" dataset
- Implements event-driven programming for user interactions
